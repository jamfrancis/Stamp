# Overview

Stamp is an iOS app that allows users to create entries (or Stamps) to document their travels. Stamps are created by adding a title, location, date, photo, and notes. Tapping on an entry opens a detail view, where users can read or edit the information. The app follows interaction paradigms consistent with native iOS apps.

This project is part of my personal growth as a software engineer focused on building real-world apps using SwiftUI. My goal was to design a simple and functional iOS app that allowed users to log their travel experiences and practice working with state management, data persistence, and SwiftUI UI elements.

# Development Environment

I used Xcode 15 on macOS to build and run the app on the built-in simulator and a physical iPhone 14 Pro and iPad Pro 11-inch. The project was written in Swift using SwiftUI for the interface.

Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for building apps on their platform. All functionality was built using built-in frameworks such as SwiftUI, Foundation, and PhotosUI for image picking.

# Future Work

* Implement iCloud or CoreData syncing to preserve data across devices
* Add search and filtering to make it easier to find past entries
* Add folders for organizing trips
* Improve photo display layout and allow multiple images per entry
